How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff compare two files and only shows the lines with a difference.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

     track the errors in a better way espicially for big programs. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    full control over file. no irrelevent commits, 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    becouse in programing some times we need supporting files to successfully run a program so we need to track multiple files simultaneously 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show the entire commit history with recent first and diff command shows the difference b/w the files  

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it is suuperb!!!    :)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for awsome version control!!!
